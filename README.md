This is a Next.js project template with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, Redux and React Hook Form slapped on. Run the development server with

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

, then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser and read through the page since I put so much effort into it. Enjoy.
